final assigment of the course HarvardX: PH526x Using Python for Research

First data science project. The idea was "attemp to predict the type of physical activity (e.g., walking, climbing stairs) from tri-axial smartphone accelerometer data." It was quite challenging because no hints were given. I did my best but I could only achieve 46% of accuracy in predictions. I think it's not extremely bad for a beginner, though (the expected accuracy purely by chance was 25%)
